# PushMonitor
Push your url addresses

---------------

PushMonitor is a simple monitoring tool that checks the accessibility of a specified URL at regular intervals and simulates "pushing" actions. This tool uses Python to periodically check the specified website's status and provide feedback on its accessibility.

PushMonitor uses an eco system, see below for how it works
